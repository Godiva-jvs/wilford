WILFORD PLACE SCHOOL is a foundation school built on the principles of peace-the meaning of WILFORD.

It is my pleasure to extend a warm welcome to you! Thank you for visiting Wilford Place school website.

Established in 2023 to provide quality and affordable education in the locality where quality education was hardly affordable for a large percentage of the locals, mainly due to the wide difference between the cost of living and standard of living.

Wilford Place is a montessori school that has a unique blend of Nigerian and British curriculum.While the curriculum structure is in accordance with the 6-3-3-4 education system in Nigeria,the British National curriculum,thus providing a much more enriching and enthusing curriculum.This made possible as a result of careful planning ,the methods of delivery and the learning resources puts to use. School runs a blended British and Nigerian curriculum to ensure that our children develop their skills and intellectual competencies that are essential for success and leadership without any limitations.

Wilford Place school believes in the total development of the child. It is our mission 'to equip our children with the skills and growth mindset to thrive and be future ready'.We aim to ensure that our children are provided with high quality learning experiences based on broad and balanced curricula. And we achieve these in an environment that is rich in activities outside the classroom. Activities that help children develop excellent social skills, good technical and hands-on skills as well as a strong God-fearing and sense of community is best achieved through co-curricular activities which go beyond academics. At no extra cost, all our children are required to participate in our co-curricular activities: 
<p>
  Music,dance,swimming,<br>football,scrabble,chess,<br>theatre arts,bead making,culinary,sewing and knitting.

</p> However,parents who would like their children to receive expert professional coaching in any of the activities have to pay an additional charge.

Again,as we are aware that the most memorable learning experiences often takes place outside the school premises, Wilford Place children have the opportunity to be involved in educational trips/visits every school term.
As you explore this website, we hope you will feel inspired. if you are a prospective parent, we hope you will make up your mind to join our happy school by enrolling your child/ward at Wilford place. Once again, thank you for visiting.
